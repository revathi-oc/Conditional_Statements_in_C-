# Conditional_Statements_in_C++
## Aim
We learn about different conditional statements in C++.
## Theory
In C++, conditional statements allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements are `if`, `else if`, and `else`. 

The `if` statement checks a condition, and if it's true, the code block inside the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is false, the program skips to the next part. The `else if` statement provides additional conditions if the previous `if` was false. The `else` statement is optional and executes a block of code if all preceding conditions are false. These statements enable complex decision-making structures in programs.

The `switch` statement is another conditional control structure that provides an alternative to multiple `if-else` conditions. It evaluates an expression and executes the corresponding `case` block that matches the expressionâ€™s value. Each `case` ends with a `break` statement to prevent fall-through to subsequent cases. If no `case` matches, an optional `default` case is executed. `switch` is particularly useful when there are multiple possible values for a single variable that need to be handled differently.

Both conditional statements and `switch` case structures are essential for controlling the flow of a C++ program, allowing it to respond dynamically to different inputs and conditions.
